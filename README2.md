# UFO Group Meeting Agenda – 11/16/2025 

# Next Steps from Proposal 

## Population Normalization - Carly 

Collect U.S. Census population by year or decade 

Join to UFO data using state (or county if available) 

Produce normalized metrics like: 

sightings per capita 

sightings per 100k people 

Identify outlier states/regions 

## Dataset: 
U.S. Census population by state (1900–2020) 
Easily downloadable from census.gov (“Intercensal Estimates” or “State Population Totals”). 

Other dataset ideas: 

Technology Adoption / Internet Access 

Goal: test whether increased reports follow increased reporting capacity. 
She can explore: 

Internet access over time 

Broadband penetration 

Home computer adoption 

 

## Suggested dataset: 
NTIA Internet Use / Broadband Adoption Data (1998–present) 
(“Digital Nation Data Explorer” → downloadable CSVs) 
This provides: 

% of households with internet 

Device ownership 

Broadband availability 
to match our proposal’s emphasis on communication technology adoption.
