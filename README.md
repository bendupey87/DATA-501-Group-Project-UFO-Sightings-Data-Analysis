# 👽 DATA-501 Group Project: UFO Sightings & Data Analysis  

Welcome to our cosmic group project! 🚀 This repository is where Team UFO (Ben, Isabella, Carly) will track, code, and share everything for our **DATA-501: Intro to Python for Data Analysis** group project.  

We’re not just crunching numbers—we’re chasing lights in the sky, spotting patterns in the unknown, and practicing solid Python and data analysis skills while we’re at it.  

**Group Members**
- Carly Hanes 
- Isabella Pastorino

## 🌌 Project Overview  

For our group project, we’re exploring **UFO sightings and related data sources**.  

- **Goal:** Analyze UFO sighting data to uncover trends, correlations, and possible reporting biases.  
- **Approach:** Use Python to wrangle, clean, and explore at least 1,000+ observations with 10+ variables.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - **Proposal** (Nov 14): dataset descriptions, initial EDA, visuals  
  - **Preliminary Report** (Dec 1) + **Peer Feedback** (Dec 2)  
  - **Final Report, Code, Presentation & Kaggle Notebook** (Dec 7)  

We’ll mix in extra context data like weather, census info, and geography to see what might influence UFO reports.

## 📂 Repo Structure  

```bash
UFO-Project/
├── data/          # raw and cleaned datasets
├── notebooks/     # Jupyter notebooks for EDA and analysis
├── reports/       # drafts, proposal, final report
├── slides/        # presentation materials
└── README.md      # this file

## 🎯 Project Fun Factor  

- We’re asking **big questions**:  
  - Are UFO sightings clustered in certain regions?  
  - Do weather or population size affect reporting?  
  - Is there a seasonal or historical trend?  
- We get to practice **Python for real-world messy data**.  
- And hey—if we *do* find aliens, that’s an automatic A, right? 👾  

---

## 📝 Notes  

- We’ll use **Zoom + Slack** for communication.  
- All code should be **clean, reproducible, and well-commented**.  
- AI usage is allowed for debugging, code snippets, and writing clarity—but not for generating entire analyses.

✨ **Stay curious. Stay skeptical. Keep your eyes on the skies.**
